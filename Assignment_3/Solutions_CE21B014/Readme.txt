Naive Bayers:
It was trained on the dataset which is available as enron1 folder and tested in dataset enron2.
The weights for the model after training are stored in spam_data.json, ham_data.json. 

The code for training the model can be found in "naive bayers_Preprocess_Train.ipynb" 

To test the model on a data as given in the problem question as in a test folder, use the file :"naive bayers_Preprocess_Test.ipynb". 

Please have all the weights as mentioned above in the same directory for the model to run and for the test data to be evaluated for the model and give results.

Perceptron :

It was trained on the dataset which is available as dataset_fin folder in the directory and tested on the same.

The code for training the model can be found in "Perceptron_Train.ipynb" 

The weights for this model after training are stored as "vocabulary.txt" and "perceptron_weights_2000.pkl"

To test the model on a data as given in the problem question as in a test folder, use the file :"Perceptron_Test.ipynb".

Please have all the weights as mentioned above in the same directory for the model to run and for the test data to be evaluated for the model and give results.


SVM:
It was trained on the dataset which is available as dataset_fin folder in the directory and tested on the same.
The code for this could be found in "SVM_train.ipynb"

Report.pdf contains the pdf file for the report.
